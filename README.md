# C-Compiler
Created a small compiler from scratch that will read an input program and represent it in a linked list. The compiler can read for loops, while loops, if else statements, and switch statements including when they are nested. Once input is read, mathematical operations can be done based on the statements and operators used. Built in 1 week using C++ and Visual Studio Code
